\section{Introduction}

The role of firm decisions in generating aggregate production network risk has long been recognized. In picking its suppliers, each firm does not account for the risk it imposes on downstream producers. This can lead to an under-sourced and fragile production networks (\cite{steve_banker_if_2020}). Furthermore, firms are often unaware of how correlated their potential suppliers' risks are. Hence, we plan to use firm level data from the Netherlands to study the role of suppliers' uncertainty in firms decisions and aggregate fragilities.


\section{Methodological Literature Review}

In recent years, there has been a surge in interest on the effect of firm level idiosyncrasies on aggregate fluctuations of production networks. The standard approach in the literature is to construct a model consisting of firm that are heterogeneous in production technology and make supplier decisions endogenously. These models are then calibrated by matching industry aggregates, such as degree distributions. Finally, the calibrated model is employed to simulate counterfactuals.

An early example of an empirical analysis of the link between microeconomic and macroeconomic shocks is \citein{carvalho_supply_2016}. The authors use the commodity-by-commodity US Requirements Tables to infer production functions between goods. Finally, they draw an edge between two industries if the supplier accounts for more than 5\% of the total inputs of a good. Finally, they calibrate the model parameters to match the distribution of the weighted out-degree observed in the dataset. Using this model, the authors simulate productivity shocks and their aggregate consequences. They find that industries with larger eigenvector centralities contribute more to aggregate fluctuations.

A similar, but more granular, approach has been employed by \citein{mathieu_taschereau-dumouchel_cascades_2020}. The authors use the FactSet Revere US firm-level production network data to calibrate an endogenous production network model with uncertainty around suppliers productivity. The authors show that, allowing for reallocations, tames the size of aggregate shocks and fluctuations in production networks. 

An example of a model agnostic approach is that of \citein{barrot_input_2016}. The authors use natural disasters to identify the role of industries in aggregate fluctuations. They find that when a natural disaster hits a supplier, firms experience an average drop by 2 to 3 percentage points in sales growth, even if the supplier represents a small share of firms' total intermediate inputs. This effect is proportional to input specificity.
