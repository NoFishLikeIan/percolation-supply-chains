	title = {Cascades and Fluctuations in an Economy with an Endogenous Production Network},
	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3115854},
	abstract = {Abstract This paper studies an economy in which the network structure of production is endogenously determined by the firms’ extensive margin of operation. In the model, a finite number of firms are connected through input-output linkages and must pay a fixed cost to produce. When economic conditions are poor, some firms might decide not to produce, thereby severing the links with their neighbors. Together, the operating decisions of the firms therefore determine the structure of the production network. Since producers benefit from having access to additional suppliers, the economy features complementarities between the operating decisions of nearby firms. As a result, if a firm exits following a severe shock, a cascade of shutdowns might spread from neighbor to neighbor as the network reorganizes itself. While well-connected firms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon shutdown, a prediction confirmed by U.S. data. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network interacts with the business cycle. As in the data, downturns feature less clustering among firms, and are associated with degree distributions with thinner tails. In addition, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens aggregate fluctuations relative to a scenario in which the network is kept fixed.},

	abstract = {Exploiting the exogenous and regional nature of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, this paper provides a systematic quantification of the role of input-output linkages as a mechanism for the propagation and amplification of shocks. We document that the disruption caused by the earthquake and its aftermaths propagated upstream and downstream supply chains, affecting the direct and indirect suppliers and customers of disaster-stricken firms. We then use our empirical findings to obtain an estimate for the overall macroeconomic impact of the shock by taking these propagation effects into account. We find that the propagation of the shock over input-output linkages can account for a 1.2 percentage point decline in Japan's gross output in the year following the earthquake. We interpret these findings in the context of a general equilibrium model that takes the firm-to-firm linkages into account explicitly.},

This paper examines the mechanisms underlying this relationship using a large cross-country industry-level panel dataset of manufacturing production and trade. We show that sector pairs that experience more bilateral trade exhibit stronger comovement. Vertical linkages in production are an important explanation behind this effect: bilateral international trade increases comovement significantly more in cross-border industry pairs that use each other as intermediate inputs. Our estimates imply that these vertical production linkages account for some 30\% of the total impact of bilateral trade on the business cycle correlation.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an analytically tractable model of balanced growth that is consistent with the observed size distribution of firms. Growth is the result of idiosyncratic firm productivity improvements, selection of successful firms, and imitation by entrants. Selection tends to improve aggregate productivity at a fast rate if entry and imitation are easy. The empirical phenomenon of Zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. The small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. A calibration based on U. S. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection. But the implied variance of the combined preference and technology shocks is puzzlingly high.},

Moreover, the indegree distribution for those hub firms also exhibits a fat tail, suggesting the existence of “super-hub” firms. Second, we find that larger firms tend to have more counterparts, but the relationship between firms’ size and the number of their counterparts is not necessarily proportional; firms that already have a large number of counterparts tend to grow without proportionately expanding it.},

Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual firm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 firms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior of large firms. This paper’s ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the fluctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.},

	abstract = {Supply chain disturbances can lead to important increases in production costs. When looking for new suppliers, firms therefore worry about the risks associated with potential trading partners. We investigate the impact of beliefs and uncertainty on the structure of the production network and, through that channel, on the level and volatility of macroeconomic aggregates. To do so, we construct a model of endogenous network formation in which uncertainty about future outcomes affects the structure of the production network. In the model, when uncertainty rises producers prefer to purchase from more stable suppliers, even though they might sell at higher prices. The resulting reorganization of the network leads to less macroeconomic volatility, but at the cost of a decline in aggregate output. We calibrate the model on U.S. data and find that the mechanism can account for a sizable decline in expected {GDP} during periods of high uncertainty like the Great Recession.},

	abstract = {Estimating the probabilities of linkages in a network has gained increasing interest in recent years. One popular model for network analysis is the exchangeable graph model ({ExGM}) characterized by a two-dimensional function known as a graphon. Estimating an underlying graphon becomes the key of such analysis. Several nonparametric estimation methods have been proposed, and some are provably consistent. However, if certain useful features of the nodes (e.g., age and schools in social network context) are available, none of these methods was designed to incorporate this source of information to help with the estimation. This paper develops a consistent graphon estimation method that integrates the information from both the adjacency matrix itself and node features. We show that properly leveraging the features can improve the estimation. A cross-validation method is proposed to automatically select the tuning parameter of the method.},

            This article examines whether firm-level idiosyncratic shocks propagate in production networks. We identify idiosyncratic shocks with the occurrence of natural disasters. We find that affected suppliers impose substantial output losses on their customers, especially when they produce specific inputs. These output losses translate into significant market value losses, and they spill over to other suppliers. Our point estimates are economically large, suggesting that input specificity is an important determinant of the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks in the economy.},
