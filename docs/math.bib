	abstract = {Graphons, short for graph functions, are limiting objects for sequences of large, finite graphs with respect to the so-called cut metric. In this expository piece, we define graphons, motivate them, and discuss how they complete the space of finite graphs. We conclude by stating three theorems that connect the finite world of graphs with the continuous world of graphons.},
