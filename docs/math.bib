	abstract = {Graphons, short for graph functions, are limiting objects for sequences of large, finite graphs with respect to the so-called cut metric. In this expository piece, we define graphons, motivate them, and discuss how they complete the space of finite graphs. We conclude by stating three theorems that connect the finite world of graphs with the continuous world of graphons.},

We obtain self-consistency relations for the conditional correlations and conditional probabilities. The beta-binomial distribution is derived by a strong symmetric assumption on the conditional correlations. Our derivation clarifies the 'correlation' structure of the beta-binomial distribution. It is also possible to study the correlation structures of other probability distributions of exchangeable (homogeneous) correlated Bernoulli random variables. We study some distribution functions and discuss their behaviors in terms of their correlation structures.},
