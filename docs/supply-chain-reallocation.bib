	abstract = {Graphons, short for graph functions, are limiting objects for sequences of large, finite graphs with respect to the so-called cut metric. In this expository piece, we define graphons, motivate them, and discuss how they complete the space of finite graphs. We conclude by stating three theorems that connect the finite world of graphs with the continuous world of graphons.},

	abstract = {We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are
              n
              products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2

              , thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.},

	abstract = {We provide a nonlinear characterization of the macroeconomic impact of microeconomic productivity shocks in terms of reduced‐form nonparametric elasticities for efficient economies. We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced‐form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the first order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by first‐order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business‐cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fat‐tailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin‐tailed. Average output losses due to short‐run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long‐run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol's cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low‐growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948–2014 in the United States.},

	abstract = {Estimating the probabilities of linkages in a network has gained increasing interest in recent years. One popular model for network analysis is the exchangeable graph model (ExGM) characterized by a two-dimensional function known as a graphon. Estimating an underlying graphon becomes the key of such analysis. Several nonparametric estimation methods have been proposed, and some are provably consistent. However, if certain useful features of the nodes (e.g., age and schools in social network context) are available, none of these methods was designed to incorporate this source of information to help with the estimation. This paper develops a consistent graphon estimation method that integrates the information from both the adjacency matrix itself and node features. We show that properly leveraging the features can improve the estimation. A cross-validation method is proposed to automatically select the tuning parameter of the method.},
