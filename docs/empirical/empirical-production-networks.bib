	abstract = {We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity and various distortions may affect costs and prices. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology/input choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input–output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we establish that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount—that is, if there are
              n
              products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2

              , thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from choice of input combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries via lower input prices and incentivize them to also adopt additional inputs.},

	abstract = {Estimating the probabilities of linkages in a network has gained increasing interest in recent years. One popular model for network analysis is the exchangeable graph model (ExGM) characterized by a two-dimensional function known as a graphon. Estimating an underlying graphon becomes the key of such analysis. Several nonparametric estimation methods have been proposed, and some are provably consistent. However, if certain useful features of the nodes (e.g., age and schools in social network context) are available, none of these methods was designed to incorporate this source of information to help with the estimation. This paper develops a consistent graphon estimation method that integrates the information from both the adjacency matrix itself and node features. We show that properly leveraging the features can improve the estimation. A cross-validation method is proposed to automatically select the tuning parameter of the method.},

	abstract = {We model the production of complex goods in a large supply network. Each firm sources several essential inputs through relationships with other firms. Individual supply relationships are at risk of idiosyncratic failure, which threatens to disrupt production. To protect against this, firms multisource inputs and strategically invest to make relationships stronger, trading off the cost of investment against the benefits of increased robustness. A supply network is called fragile if aggregate output is very sensitive to small aggregate shocks. We show that supply networks of intermediate productivity are fragile in equilibrium, even though this is always inefficient. The endogenous configuration of supply networks provides a new channel for the powerful amplification of shocks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08021},
	abstract = {Supply chains are the backbone of the global economy. Disruptions to them can be costly. Centrally managed supply chains invest in ensuring their resilience. Decentralized supply chains, however, must rely upon the self-interest of their individual components to maintain the resilience of the entire chain. We examine the incentives that independent self-interested agents have in forming a resilient supply chain network in the face of production disruptions and competition. In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield uncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time uncertainty or, "soft" supply caps). Competing retailers must decide which suppliers to link to based on both price and reliability. In the presence of yield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse. Retailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea that they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base. This happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that competition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as well, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander graphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby, providing the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain networks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs. Finally, we show that a supplier's investments in improved yield can make it worse off. This happens because high production output saturates the market, which, in turn lowers prices and profits for participants.},

	abstract = {Supply chain disturbances can lead to important increases in production costs. When looking for new suppliers, firms therefore worry about the risks associated with potential trading partners. We investigate the impact of beliefs and uncertainty on the structure of the production network and, through that channel, on the level and volatility of macroeconomic aggregates. To do so, we construct a model of endogenous network formation in which uncertainty about future outcomes affects the structure of the production network. In the model, when uncertainty rises producers prefer to purchase from more stable suppliers, even though they might sell at higher prices. The resulting reorganization of the network leads to less macroeconomic volatility, but at the cost of a decline in aggregate output. We calibrate the model on U.S. data and find that the mechanism can account for a sizable decline in expected GDP during periods of high uncertainty like the Great Recession.},

            This article examines whether firm-level idiosyncratic shocks propagate in production networks. We identify idiosyncratic shocks with the occurrence of natural disasters. We find that affected suppliers impose substantial output losses on their customers, especially when they produce specific inputs. These output losses translate into significant market value losses, and they spill over to other suppliers. Our point estimates are economically large, suggesting that input specificity is an important determinant of the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks in the economy.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3115854},
	abstract = {Abstract This paper studies an economy in which the network structure of production is endogenously determined by the firms’ extensive margin of operation. In the model, a finite number of firms are connected through input-output linkages and must pay a fixed cost to produce. When economic conditions are poor, some firms might decide not to produce, thereby severing the links with their neighbors. Together, the operating decisions of the firms therefore determine the structure of the production network. Since producers benefit from having access to additional suppliers, the economy features complementarities between the operating decisions of nearby firms. As a result, if a firm exits following a severe shock, a cascade of shutdowns might spread from neighbor to neighbor as the network reorganizes itself. While well-connected firms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon shutdown, a prediction confirmed by U.S. data. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network interacts with the business cycle. As in the data, downturns feature less clustering among firms, and are associated with degree distributions with thinner tails. In addition, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens aggregate fluctuations relative to a scenario in which the network is kept fixed.},

We then use our empirical findings to obtain an estimate for the overall macroeconomic impact of the shock by taking these propagation effects into account. We find that the propagation of the shock over input-output linkages can account for a 1.2 percentage point decline in Japan's gross output in the year following the earthquake. We interpret these findings in the context of a general equilibrium model that takes the firm-to-firm linkages into account explicitly.},

The empirical phenomenon of Zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. The small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. A calibration based on U. S. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection.
