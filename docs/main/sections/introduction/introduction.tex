Firms operating in a production network often need to diversify sources to deal with supply chain risk. Nevertheless, the structure of the supply chain, beyond their immediate suppliers, is usually unobservable. In this paper, I construct a stylised production game to study the relatioship between the opacity of the supply chain, firms' diversification decisions, and production network fragility. In the model, unobserved correlation among suppliers generates fragility via two channels. First, it directly introduces endogenous correlation in downstream firms' risk, which propagates through the production network. Then, it increase the probability of tail events in which the entire production network is unable to produce. Second, it indirectly affects firms' diversification decisions \notes{in what way}. The latter channel leads to firms diversifying increasingly less, such that, arbitrary small shocks in basal risk can generate cascading failures downstream.
